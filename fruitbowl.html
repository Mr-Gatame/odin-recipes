    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>At First Watch, we try not to jump on trendy culinary bandwagons. But after chia seeds started popping up everywhere and in everything, we gave this powerhouse seed a close look and found it fit perfectly with our food mission. Chia seeds contain
        lots of healthy omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, antioxidants and protein but some people are put off by the texture. That's why we soak the seeds in full-fat coconut milk, giving the dish a creamy-pudding- like appeal. We top it with blackberry
        preserves, housemade granola and mounds of fresh fruit for the perfect balance</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h5>For Chia Seed Pudding</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup black chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups coconut milk, canned (culinary coconut milk, not the beverage)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup agave nectar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For Superfoods Bowl</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 slice whole-grain artisan bread</li>
        <li>1/4 cup almond butter</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Maldon sea salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chia Seed Pudding (recipe above)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons blackberry preserves</li>
        <li>1/2 banana, sliced 1/8 inch thick</li>
        <li>2 strawberries, quartered (8 pieces)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup blueberries</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granola</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>

    <h5>Prepare Chia Seed Pudding</h5>
    <ol>

        <li>Transfer to a large, airtight container.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight, if possible) before use to allow the chia to "bloom." Stirring may be required after 1 hour.</li>
